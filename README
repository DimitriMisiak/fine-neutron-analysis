for the fine analysis of the ROOT file from NEPAL.

Launch in this order:

1)batch_pipeline_data_raw.py (Very Long)
2)batch_pipeline_data_reconstructed.py (Short)
3)batch_pipeline_data_quality.py (Short)
    --> iterative feedback on parameters with batch_graph_quality.py
4)manual_crosstalk_correction.py to estimate the cabling capacity
5) edit cabling capacity into batch_pipeline_xtalk.py
    --> sanity graphs with batch_graph_xtalk.py
4)batch_manual_ion_calib.py and use the result to edit batch_pipeline_data_ion_calib.py
4)pipeline_data_ion_calib.py (Short)
    --> sanity graphs with batch_graph_ion_calib.py
5)batch_manual_10keV_selection.py, select manually the 10keV events
6)batch_manual_heat_calib.py and use the result to edit batch_pipeline_data_heat_calib.py
7)batch_pipeline_data_heat_calib.py
    --> sanity graphs with batch_graph_heat_calib.py	
8)batch_science_plots.py
